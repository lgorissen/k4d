# 25. Persistent Volumes: hiding tech details from the developer

In all the labs about Volumes, we (well actually: I) skipped the network and Cloud Volume types. Labs for these types also require access to these types of Volumes, which may not be possible in the environment where you run your labs (like minikube on a VM).

Nevertheless, let's have a look at a manifest file for a Volume of type *gcePersistentDisk*, in a Pod specification:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod                               # this is a Pod specification 
metadata:
  name: test-pd                         # Pod name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:                           # Container specification
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:                       # A Volume is mounted in the container
    - mountPath: /test-pd               # ... mountpoint is /test-pd
      name: test-volume                 # ... name of Volume is test-volume
  volumes:                              # Volume specification
  - name: test-volume                   # ... Volume test-volume
    gcePersistentDisk:                  # ... of type gcePersistentDisk
      pdName: my-data-disk              # ... name of the (already existing!) GCE PD 
      fsType: ext4                      # ... and its file type
```

The above example is taken from the Kubernetes reference documentation, and is therefore correct ;-)

However, there are 2 things about this approach that we don't like:

1. The Volume specification has technical details that you normally don't want to bother the application developer with. Knowing technical details about storage is more a Kubernetes admin thingie...
2. The Pod specification is often considered to define the application. Now, if you want to run this application (Pod) on a different Kubernetes cluster that has different storage types, you need to change the Pod specification. Bwah.

As it turns out, the Kubernetes folks also did not like this, so they helped us with a solution: Persistent Volumes! 

![persistent volumes](img/lab25-persistent-volumes.png)

In the figure above:

**Kubernetes developer**

- Creates the Pod specification
- Defines a Volume in the Pod specification that refers to a Persistent Volume claim
- Defines the Persistent Volume Claim object that describes the storage that is requested

As a result, the Pod specification has no Volume/storage implementation details.

**Kubernetes admin**
 
 - Ensures that physical storage is available - in our example Cloud storage in the Google Cloud: GCE PD
 - Creates a Persistent Volume object that represents this storage
 
 Note that a Persistent Volume is a resource on Cluster level, i.e. it does not belong to any Namespace.
 
**Kubernetes**

- Kubernetes itself matches the Persistent Volume Claim with a corresponding Persistent Volume


## 25.1 Manifest files for the GCE PD case

The Pod manifest that was used above, would transform to:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod                               # this is a Pod specification 
metadata:
  name: test-pd                         # Pod name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:                           # Container specification
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:                       # A Volume is mounted in the container
    - mountPath: /test-pd               # ... mountpoint is /test-pd
      name: test-volume                 # ... name of Volume is test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume                   # Start of specification of Volume test-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:              # this is the only change: refer to a 
      claimName: terra10-pvc            # ... persistentVolumeClaim
```


The Persistent Volume Claim describes what storage it needs:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim   # object type PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: terra10-pvc           # pvc name is terra10-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce           # storage access mode: see below
  volumeMode: Filesystem      # see below
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi            # storageSize
  storageClassName: ""        # see lab on dynamic volume provisioning
```

**accessMode**

The *accessMode* describes how the volume will be mounted on a node:

- ReadWriteOnce (RWO) – the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
- ReadOnlyMany (ROX) – the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
- ReadWriteMany (RWX) – the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

**volumeMode**

The *volumeMode* distinguishes between a raw block device (raw) or a filesystem (filesystem).


The Persistent Volume describes the storage:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume        # type of storage
metadata:
  name: pv0001                # name of PV
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 8Gi              # size
  accessModes:                # see description above
    - ReadWriteOnce           # read-write by single node
  gcePersistentDisk:          # the GCE storage
    fsType: ext4              # ... that should be present
    pdName: my-data-disk      # ... ask the k8s admin ;-)
```



## 25.2 Kubernetes & matching PVC and PV

The example in the previous section describes a PVC and PV. When Kubernetes gets the PVC, it will have to select a matching PV. In our case, the selection would 'look for an 8GB file system with RWO access mode'. 

To guide this matching process it is possible to add a label selector to the Persistent Volume Claim. This label selector will specify a label query that will be used to determine what Persistent Volumes are considered for binding. For example:

```bash
  selector:               # label selector helps with selecting the right Persistent Volume
    matchLabels:
      release: "stable"
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [dev]}
```

## 25.3 Lifespan of PVC and PV

It is important to understand the lifespan of PVC, PV and Pod. In general:

- The Persistent Volume is created by the k8s admin and ceases to exist when the admin deletes it.
- The Persistent Volume Claim is a Kubernetes object with its own lifespan. It is created by the Kubernetes user and at some point deleted by the user. Upon deletion of the Persistent Volume Claim, the Persistent Volume will be recycled and can then be claimed by another PVC.
- The Pod can mount a PVC and unmount it at the end of its lifespan. When the Pod unmounts the PVC, the PVC (and its data) remain present to be mounted by another Pod.

However, other possibilities also exist: it is possible to define a *reclaim policy* for a PV that defines different behaviour. Please consult the Kubernetes reference documentation for more information on this.

## 25.4 Storage is difficult!

There is a good reason why Persistent Volumes are introduced in Kubernetes: storage is difficult and in general requires knowledge that the average developer (no ... not you ... the others!) does not have. This lab only scratches the surface of Persistent Volumes. Sound advice: when designing the Storage for your application, get someone involved who has the right knowledge!


## 25.5 Finally, a Lab exercise 
...Albeit a simple one...

Like before, we will not do a lab exercise with network or Cloud storage involved.

Instead, we will use the hostPath storage: it accesses the local file system on the Cluster Node. So, for production situations where you want to access local files (mostly system related) that could be OK. And for testing purposes. BUT ... NOT for production purposes.

Anyway, we want to make a configuration that looks like this:

![](img/lab25-persistent-volumes-hostPath.png)

This is pretty similar to the set-up we made in `lab 18`, where the storage for the Pod was an emptyDir Volume. This time, we will use Persistent Volumes to create a more persistent storage.

Let's first have a look at the 3 manifest files that we need:

1. Persistent Volume: `terra10-transporter-pv.yaml`
2. Persistent Volume Claim: `terra10-transporter-pvc.yaml`
3. Pod: `terra10-transporter.yaml`

The manifest files can be found in the `lab 25` directory.

**Persistent Volume: terra10-transporter-pv.yaml**

The manifest looks like:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume                  # definition of a PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter-pv          # ... named terra10-transporter-pv
spec:                                   # specification of the Volume
  capacity:                             # capacity:
    storage: 1Gi                        # ... 1 Gi
  accessModes:                          # allowed accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce                     # read-write by a single node
    - ReadOnlyMany                      # read-only by many nodes
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain # allows for manual reclamation of the resource
  hostPath:
    path: /tmp/terra10-transporter      # path to part of local storage is used
```

Now, let's create the Persistent Volume:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter-pv.yaml 
persistentvolume/terra10-transporter-pv created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl get pv terra10-transporter-pv 
NAME                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM     STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE

developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl describe pv terra10-transporter-pv

Finalizers:      [kubernetes.io/pv-protection]

    HostPathType:  
Events:            <none>
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$
```


**Persistent Volume Claim: terra10-transporter-pvc.yaml**

The Persistent Volume Claim manifest file:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim      # definition of PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter-pvc  # name...
spec:
  resources:                     # definition of compute resources for this Volume
    requests:                    # definition of minimum requested resources
      storage: 1Gi               # how much storage is requird
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce                # required acces mode: read-write by a single node
  storageClassName: ""           # you will learn about this in the next lab
```

Claim the Volume:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter-pvc.yaml 
persistentvolumeclaim/terra10-transporter-pvc created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl get pvc terra10-transporter-pvc 
NAME                      STATUS    VOLUME                   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
terra10-transporter-pvc   Bound     terra10-transporter-pv   1Gi        RWO,ROX                       6s
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl describe pvc terra10-transporter-pvc 
Name:          terra10-transporter-pvc
Namespace:     default
StorageClass:  
Status:        Bound
Volume:        terra10-transporter-pv
Labels:        <none>
Annotations:   pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed=yes
               pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller=yes
Finalizers:    [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection]
Capacity:      1Gi
Access Modes:  RWO,ROX
Events:        <none>
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$
```

Note that the previously created Permanent Volume *terra10-transporter-pv* is immediately bound to this claim!


**Pod: terra10-transporter.yaml**

Now that both the Permanent Volume Claim and the Permanent Volume are created, it is time to create the Pod. First, have a look at its manifest file:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter                # definition of Pod terra10-transporter
spec:
  containers:                              # ... with 2 Containers:
  - image: lgorissen/terra10-transporter   # 1. terra10-transporter Container
    name: terra10-transporter
    volumeMounts:
    - name: transportlog                   # mounts transportlog Volume
      mountPath: /tmp                      # same like before
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8092
      protocol: TCP
  - image: lgorissen/terra10-monitor       # 2. terra10-monitor Container
    name: terra10-monitor
    volumeMounts:
    - name: transportlog                   # mounts transportlog Volume
      mountPath: /var/log                  # same like before
      readOnly: true
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8090
      protocol: TCP
  volumes:                                 # Volume definition
  - name: transportlog                     # ... for the transportlog Volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:                 # ... is a PersistentVolumeClaim
      claimName: terra10-transporter-pvc   # ... with name terra10-transporter-pvc

```

Note how similar this manifest is to the one for `lab 18`: only the Volume specification has changed!

Go!

...
```

Note above:

- the Mounts with each Container, and
- the Volume itself

If you have come this far, you should have a working Pod, so... test!

## 25.6 Test

First, test the functionality of the Pod:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl '172.17.0.12:8090/?name=Luc&from=DenBosch&to=Moon'
Hello, Luc will be transported from DenBosch to Moon using the Terra10 transporter service
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl 172.17.0.12:8092
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ 
```

The transporter and monitor functionality are working. Now check the transporter log file on the Node file system:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ more /tmp/terra10-transporter/transporter.log 
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$
```

Just to be a nuisance, let's stop the Containers and then check what the new Containers do. The Container IDs can be retrieved in the Pod's description above:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ docker stop 54039
54039
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ docker stop 0e99f
0e99f
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl '172.17.0.12:8090/?name=Elvis&from=DenBosch&to=Moon'
Hello, Elvis will be transported from DenBosch to Moon using the Terra10 transporter service
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl 172.17.0.12:8092
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
Elvis is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ more /tmp/terra10-transporter/transporter.log 
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
Elvis is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ 
```

Just what we expected: the new Containers will use the same Volume.

Now we delete the Pod and then recreate it again:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl delete pod terra10-transporter
pod "terra10-transporter" deleted
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter.yaml 
pod/terra10-transporter created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl '172.17.0.12:8090/?name=JimmyHoffa&from=DenBosch&to=Moon'
Hello, JimmyHoffa will be transported from DenBosch to Moon using the Terra10 transporter service
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ curl 172.17.0.12:8092
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
Elvis is transported from DenBosch to Moon
JimmyHoffa is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ 
```

Final tests: when we delete the Pod, PVC and PV, the transport.log file should still be present, due to the *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy* that was set to *Retain*:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl delete pod terra10-transporter
pod "terra10-transporter" deleted
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl delete pvc terra10-transporter-pvc 
persistentvolumeclaim "terra10-transporter-pvc" deleted
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl describe pv terra10-transporter-pv

developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ kubectl delete pv terra10-transporter-pv 
persistentvolume "terra10-transporter-pv" deleted
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$ more /tmp/terra10-transporter/transporter.log 
Luc is transported from DenBosch to Moon
Elvis is transported from DenBosch to Moon
JimmyHoffa is transported from DenBosch to Moon
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 25$
```


Phew ... long Lab it was.
