# 21. Volume configMap

Your Pod consists of a number of Containers, and each one of them requires configuration data - well, except for the most simple cases. 

## 21.1 Containers and Pod specification

For Docker Containers, configuration information can be passed to the container as:
1. Command-line arguments 
2. Environment variables

### 21.1.1. Pod specification and Command-line arguments
How a Docker Container is started is defined in the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile uses the ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions to start the image. The preferred way to do this is to:

- Use ENTRYPOINT in the exec format: `ENTRYPOINT ["<executable>" , "<par 1>", "<par 2>", ...]`
- Use CMD to define additional default parameters to ENTRYPOINT: `CMD [ "<par a>", "<par b>", ...]`

With this approach:
- ENTRYPOINT ensures that the Container can start without additional parameters
- CMD ensures that the optional parameters have sensible default values

Example:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/myterra.sh"]
CMD ["60"]
```

In Kubernetes, the Container specification in a Pod can override the ENTRYPOINT and CMD entries. This is how they map/match:

| Docker  | Kubernetes - Container specification in Pod |
|---------|-------------|
| ENTRYPOINT | command |
| CMD     | args |

For example, the Container specification in a Pod manifest file could look like:

```bash
kind: Pod
spec: 
  containers:
  - image: lgorissen/terra10
    command: ["/bin/my-terra-command"]  # override ENTRYPOINT
    args: ["10"]                        # override CMD
```

### 21.1.2. Pod specification and Environment variables

Many Containers rely on environment variables for their configuration. Therefore, Kubernetes allows you to define environment variables. Those environment variables are specified in the Pod specification, but on the Container level. That makes sense, as this keeps the Containers independent. In the Pod manifest file, the configuration of environment variables is done like shown below:

```bash
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: lgorissen/terra10
    env:
    - name: TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM
      value: "12"

```
For the Terra10 transporter Container, the environment variable 'TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM' defines ... what platform is used for transporting ;-)

### 21.1.3 Pod specification and configuration - a small exercise

**Docker Container lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config**

We have a Container named `lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config`, that has two configuration options:

1.  Environment variable TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM
2.  Command line argument that indicates the 'transporter delay'. It has a default value (in the Dockerfile) of 60.

The Docker container can be started manually and then used. Note:

- the environment variable is passed to the Container using `-e TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM=local_13`
- the command line argument is passed to the Container after the container name: `30`


```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ docker run -d --name terra10-transporter-config -p 8096:8096 -e TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM=local_13 lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config 30

developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ 
```
**Pod specification using Docker Container lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config**

The same Container can be used in a Pod. The manifest file `terra10-transporter-config` can be found in the `lab 21` directory:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter-config
spec:
  containers:
  - image: lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config
    env:
    - name: TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM
      value: "local_container"
    args: ["12"]
    name: terra10-transporter-config
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8096
      protocol: TCP
```

Run and test:

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter-config.yaml 
pod/terra10-transporter-config created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl describe pod terra10-transporter-config | grep "^IP:" 
IP:           172.17.0.11
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ curl 172.17.0.11:8096
Hello, transporter local_container will transport you in 12 seconds 
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$
```


### 21.1.4 Pod specification and configuration - not a happy marriage

It does not take a Kubernetes wizard to understand that hard-coding configuration information in a Pod specification is not a desirable situation. You will end up with different Pod specifications for different environments. As the Pod is basically your application specification, it does not feel good to have a different specification for each environment. The configuration data has to go: please welcome the ConfigMap.

## 21.2 ConfigMap to the rescue...

The ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object which contains key-value pairs. The values are passed into the Containers as environment variables or as files in a Volume.

![configMap to the rescue](img/lab21-configMap.png)

The Pod refers to a configMap by name. In that way, the *different configuration for different environments* question is addressed:

![configMap and environments](img/lab21-configMap-and-environments.png)

Note that configuration of different environments in this example requires those different environments to be handled in different Kubernetes namespaces! Which is a sensible thing to do anyway...


## 21.3 configMap example

Now it's time to start putting the configMap to use. Our goal is to use the configMap for the above example. So we need a configMap and a Pod manifest that refers to it. 

**ConfigMap manifest**

First, create a ConfigMap that has the 2 configuration items for the `lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config` Container. It is in the file `terra10-transporter-configMap.yaml` which lives in the `lab 21` directory:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap                             # object type ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter-config          # name of the configMap
data:
  transporter-delay: "45"                   # key-value pair
  transporter-platform: "local_development" # key-value pair
```


**Pod manifest**

Now that the configMap is defined, the Pod manifest (`terra10-transporter-pod.yaml`) is using it. In this example we see how a Container argument and an environment variable get their values from the `terra10-transporter-config` ConfigMap that was defined previously.

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: terra10-transporter                      # name of the Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: lgorissen/terra10-transporter:config  # name of the Container image
    env:
    - name: TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM                 # Container has env var TRANSPORTER_PLATFORM
      valueFrom:                                 # start of def where the var gets its value
        configMapKeyRef:                         # ... from a ConfigMap
          name: terra10-transporter-config       # ... named terra10-transporter-config
          key: transporter-platform              # ... using key transporter-platform
    - name: TRANSPORTER_DELAY                    # Container has env var TRANSPORTER_DELAY
      valueFrom:                                 # start of def where the var gets its value
        configMapKeyRef:                         # ... from a ConfigMap
          name: terra10-transporter-config       # ... named terra10-transporter-config
          key: transporter-delay                 # ... using key transporter-delay
    args: ["$(TRANSPORTER_DELAY)"]               # and the argument is set using the env var!
    name: terra10-transporter                    # Container name
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8096                        # port
      protocol: TCP
```

Note in the above manifest file how the Container argument is set using the environment variable.


Running and testing the things is done in 4 steps:

1. Create the ConfigMap and look at its contents
2. Create the Pod
3. Look up the IP address of the Pod
4. curl to the Pod

```bash
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter-configMap.yaml 
configmap/terra10-transporter-config created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl describe configmaps terra10-transporter-config 
Name:         terra10-transporter-config
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Data
====
transporter-delay:
----
45
transporter-platform:
----
local_development
Events:  <none>
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl create -f terra10-transporter-pod.yaml 
pod/terra10-transporter created
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ kubectl describe pod terra10-transporter | grep "^IP:"
IP:           172.17.0.12
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ curl 172.17.0.12:8096
Hello, transporter local_development will transport you in 45 seconds 
developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/projects/k4d/lab 21$ 
```

We may be on to something good here... but ... clean up!
